<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">1. ROLEPLAI</h3>

This solution enables users such as recruiters to conduct simulated conversations for various scenarios, providing them with invaluable practice and feedback. The AI coach delivers objective evaluations at the conclusion of each interaction, highlighting areas for improvement and reinforcing best practices. This innovative approach empowers recruiters to hone their skills and confidently navigate complex recruitment situations, ultimately reducing dependence on traditional, physically present coaches.

<!-- 1. **Algorithmic techniques for genome resequencing.**
   Mapping sequences to a reference genome is often the first computational step in deriving biological insights from genomic data. Accurate mapping of sequences is key to predict genetic or epigenetic variation. Doing this precisely has been challenging as human and other mammalian genomes are [riddled with near-identical repetitive sequences](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002384). Such repeats often confuse existing sequence mappers, resulting in false-positive alignments and poor confidence scores. Desirable characteristics of a mapper include: (i) efficiency of the algorithm, (ii) high sensitivity and specificity, and (iii) scalability to large data sets and human genomes. In this project, we aim to develop provably-good and practical 'repeat-aware' mapping algorithms that meet these expectations. -->

<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">2. Video transcreation of English Lectures to multiple Indian Languages</h3>
<br>
This is a description of a Transcreation of Lectures from English to multiple Indian Languages. To try the demo, pls click on the [link](https://asr.iitm.ac.in/demo/avr) here. <br/> <br/>
Modules Involved: 
<br/>
<ul>
<li> Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Transcription of original audio </li>
<li> Text Correction: Correction and removal of disfluencies </li>
<li> Domain Term Discovery: Identifying and translating domain-specific terms </li>
<li> Machine Translation (MT): Text-to-text translation into the target language </li>
<li> Text Chunking: Chunking of text using target language rhythm </li>
<li> Text-to-Speech Synthesis (TTS): Synthesis of translated text into speech </li>
<li> Isochronous Lip-syncing: Matching synthesized speech with original video lip  movements </li>
</ul>
<br/>

<br/>

Challenges faced: <br/>
<ul>

   <li> Language Families: Differences in audio duration between source and target languages </li>
    <li>Speaker's Rhythm: Difficulty in replicating the original speaker's rhythm, especially in conversational speech </li>
    <li>Semi-automatic Approach: Balancing automation with maintaining naturalness and accuracy </li>
    <li> Language-specific Challenges: Unique linguistic features and nuances of each Indian language </li>
    <li> Technology Limitations: Dependence on the quality and capabilities of ASR, MT, and TTS systems </li>
    <li> Resource Constraints: Availability of high-quality training data and models for all languages</li>

</ul>

   <!-- These include (i) development of theoretically well-founded sequence mapping algorithms and heuristics for genome-graphs, (ii) quantification of the benefit of adopting pan-genome approaches, and (iii) designing algorithms to build pan-genome graphs using millions of genomes as input. In each of the three aims, synergy is desired with downstream biological and clinical applications. -->
