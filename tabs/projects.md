<h3 style="font-weight: bold;">1. ROLEPLAI</h3>

This solution enables users such as recruiters to conduct simulated conversations for various scenarios, providing them with invaluable practice and feedback. The AI coach delivers objective evaluations at the conclusion of each interaction, highlighting areas for improvement and reinforcing best practices. This innovative approach empowers recruiters to hone their skills and confidently navigate complex recruitment situations, ultimately reducing dependence on traditional, physically present coaches.

As a result, scalable algorithms and software are indispensable components of computational biology. Our research within this area builds on and extends approximate similarity search, string, geometric and graph algorithms, along with their parallelisation on modern multicore computing platforms. Through interdisciplinary collaborations, we have developed new algorithms and widely-used bioinformatics [software](/software) to accelerate sequence analysis. Our active projects and their corresponding papers from our lab are listed below.

<!-- 1. **Algorithmic techniques for genome resequencing.**
   Mapping sequences to a reference genome is often the first computational step in deriving biological insights from genomic data. Accurate mapping of sequences is key to predict genetic or epigenetic variation. Doing this precisely has been challenging as human and other mammalian genomes are [riddled with near-identical repetitive sequences](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002384). Such repeats often confuse existing sequence mappers, resulting in false-positive alignments and poor confidence scores. Desirable characteristics of a mapper include: (i) efficiency of the algorithm, (ii) high sensitivity and specificity, and (iii) scalability to large data sets and human genomes. In this project, we aim to develop provably-good and practical 'repeat-aware' mapping algorithms that meet these expectations. -->

   <!-- These include (i) development of theoretically well-founded sequence mapping algorithms and heuristics for genome-graphs, (ii) quantification of the benefit of adopting pan-genome approaches, and (iii) designing algorithms to build pan-genome graphs using millions of genomes as input. In each of the three aims, synergy is desired with downstream biological and clinical applications. -->
